# ✅ AUTHORIZATION FIX - COMPLETE!

**Date:** 26 Oktober 2025  
**Issue:** Unauthorized access for Students/Guardians/Teachers pages  
**Status:** 🟢 FIXED & TESTED

---

## 🐛 PROBLEM IDENTIFIED

### **Root Cause:**
Controllers were refactored to use **Profile model**, but authorization still used old policies for **Student, Guardian, Teacher models**.

**Error Flow:**
```
User visits /students
    ↓
StudentsController calls: $this->authorize('viewAny', Profile::class)
    ↓
Laravel looks for ProfilePolicy
    ↓
❌ ProfilePolicy NOT REGISTERED
    ↓
403 Unauthorized!
```

---

## ✅ SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED

### **1. Created ProfilePolicy** ✅

**File:** `app/Policies/ProfilePolicy.php`

**Authorization Rules:**
```php
viewAny()  → Always TRUE (everyone can see list)
view()     → Own profile OR has 'manage-users'
create()   → Has 'manage-users' permission
update()   → Has 'manage-users' permission
delete()   → Has 'manage-users' permission
```

**Logic:**
- **Admin** (has `manage-users` permission) → Full access
- **Teacher/Student/Guardian** → Can only view their own profile
- **Guest** → No access (handled by auth middleware)

---

### **2. Registered ProfilePolicy** ✅

**File:** `app/Providers/AuthServiceProvider.php`

**Changes:**
```php
protected $policies = [
    Profile::class => ProfilePolicy::class,  // ← NEW!
    // Keep old policies for backward compatibility
    Guardian::class => GuardianPolicy::class,
    Student::class => StudentPolicy::class,
    Teacher::class => TeacherPolicy::class,
];
```

**Why keep old policies?**
- Some old code might still reference old models
- Safe migration approach
- Can remove later when fully migrated

## 🧪 TESTING RESULTS

### **Test 1: Admin User** ✅

```
👤 Admin User
Roles: admin
Has manage-users: YES

Policy Tests:
✅ viewAny: YES
✅ view: YES
✅ create: YES
✅ update: YES
✅ delete: YES
```

**Result:** Admin has FULL ACCESS ✅

---

### **Test 2: Teacher User** ✅

```
👤 Teacher User
Roles: teacher
Has manage-users: NO

Policy Tests:
✅ viewAny: YES (can see list)
❌ view: NO (can't view others' profiles)
❌ create: NO (expected)
❌ update: NO (expected)
❌ delete: NO (expected)
```

**Result:** Non-admin RESTRICTED correctly ✅

## 🎯 AUTHORIZATION MATRIX

| Action | Admin | Teacher | Student | Guardian |
|--------|-------|---------|---------|----------|
| **View List** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| **View Profile** | ✅ All | 🟡 Own only | 🟡 Own only | 🟡 Own only |
| **Create** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| **Update** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| **Delete** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No |

---

## 🔒 PERMISSION GATE

**Permission:** `manage-users`

**Who has it?**
```php
Gate::define('manage-users', fn ($user) => $user->hasRole('admin'));
```

Only **Admin** role has `manage-users` permission.

**Controllers check:**
```php
$this->authorize('create', Profile::class);
// Calls ProfilePolicy::create($user)
// Which checks: $user->can('manage-users')
```

---

## 📊 BEFORE vs AFTER

### **BEFORE (Broken):**
```php
// Controller
$this->authorize('viewAny', Profile::class);

// Laravel looks for ProfilePolicy
// ❌ NOT REGISTERED → 403 Unauthorized
```

### **AFTER (Fixed):**
```php
// Controller
$this->authorize('viewAny', Profile::class);

// Laravel finds ProfilePolicy
// ✅ Calls ProfilePolicy::viewAny($user)
// ✅ Returns true → Access granted!
```

---

## 🚀 PAGE ACCESS NOW WORKS

### **Students Page (`/students`)**
```
StudentsController::index()
    ↓
$this->authorize('viewAny', Profile::class)
    ↓
ProfilePolicy::viewAny($user) → return true
    ↓
✅ Page loads successfully!
```

### **Guardians Page (`/guardians`)**
```
GuardianController::index()
    ↓
$this->authorize('viewAny', Profile::class)
    ↓
ProfilePolicy::viewAny($user) → return true
    ↓
✅ Page loads successfully!
```

### **Teachers Page (`/teachers`)**
```
TeachersController::index()
    ↓
$this->authorize('viewAny', Profile::class)
    ↓
ProfilePolicy::viewAny($user) → return true
    ↓
✅ Page loads successfully!
```

## 🎯 WHAT'S PROTECTED

### **Everyone Can:**
- ✅ View list pages (filtered by menu permissions)
- ✅ View their own profile

### **Only Admin Can:**
- ✅ Create students/guardians/teachers
- ✅ Update any profile
- ✅ Delete any profile
- ✅ See "Tambah" and "Edit" buttons (canManage checks)

### **Frontend Permission Check:**
```tsx
{canManage && (
    <Button onClick={openCreateModal}>
        Tambah Santri
    </Button>
)}
```

**canManage comes from:**
```php
// Controller
'canManage' => $request->user()?->can('manage-users') ?? false,
```
